# 🎓  TP - JavaScript

You have 7 hours to realize the following case.

**You will be evaluated on your ability to meet the following 📝 functional goals.**

___

## `JavaScript and Web Services`

The job is about login `user` for an `email` and a `password`:
> You have an API `endpoint` detailed on `vivifyscrum` in the done column for the active sprint.
* 📝 The application must display a `loading` and hide a login `button` while the request is processing
* 📝 The application must display a login `button` and hide a `loading` while the request is not processing
* 📝 The application must display `error` for a `500`, `404` and `0` status code
* 📝 The application must affect the response `token` to the `user` model if the user is logged successfuly
* 📝 The application must navigate to `home` component if the user is logged successfuly

*The job is approximatively the same that in the register component, the api response retrieve an user with a token, affect the token to your model. You have to redirect to home component: create it and interesse you to how to navigate to an other component.*

___

## `Routing`

The job is about navigate between components:

* 📝 The application have to be able to navigate from a component to an other
* 📝 The application have to associate an url to a component

[@see history.pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState)
